Thanks for checking out my mod!

A fair warning the code can get messy at times but I try to comment what I can,
so it can be understood. The mod may be a little small now, but I plan on giving
it more updates over time!

Below is a list of all the features currently in the mod

Buddycard Sets
Every set of cards has a pack to go with it. They can be found in various ways.
Each set consists of 27 normal cards, and 27 shiny variant cards. Every pack
has 3 normal cards and 1 shiny card. There are 4 rarities of cards, which each
have lower odds of appearing. Common cards are cards #1-12 of a set. Uncommon
cards are cards #13-21 of a set, and have 2 yellow corners. Rare cards are cards
#22-25 of a set, and have 4 blue corners. Mythic cards are cards #26 and #27 of
a set, and they have 2 purple corners and 2 yellow corners. Upon completing a set
you will recieve a medallion as a prize. Each set has a different medal, and at
the moment each player can only get 1 of each.

Base Set
Packs can be found in abandoned mineshafts, buried treasure, desert pyramids,
shipwreck treasure, dungeons, villages, and bonus chests. You can also farm the
packs by killing baby variants of zombies, villagers, and zombie villagers. If you
have curios installed, the medal will give you speed 1 when equipped in the medal
slot.

Nether Set
Packs can be found in bastions, ruined portals, and nether fortresses. You can also
farm the packs by killing baby piglins or zombified piglins. You can also rarely get
them as an extra gift while bartering. If you have curios installed, the medal will
give you fire resistance 1 when equipped in the medal slot.

End Set
Packs can be found in end city chests, by killing the dragon, or as a rare drop from
Shulkers. If you have curios installed, the medal will give you resistance 1 when
equipped in the medal slot, along with occasionally clearing you of levitation.

Byg Set
Packs currently are obtained by combining a base set pack with rainbow eucalyptus
logs, ebony logs, therium, and embur gel. If you have curios installed, the medal
will give you speed 2 and jump boost 1.

Binders
Binders can be crafted similarly to books, except with buddycards instead of paper.
The color of the binder depends on the cards used to make it. Each binder can hold
54 cards each, which means it can hold every card, including shiny variants, of a
given set.

Card Displays
Made with 1 wood plank and 6 sticks, a card display can be placed to hold 6 cards
on a wall. They come in all vanilla wood varieties. If you have Byg installed, they
also come in all byg varieties.

Config
The config file of the mod allows adjusting of the odds of packs dropping when the
player kills specific mobs. Type in a decimal value of what percentage of kills
drop packs.
